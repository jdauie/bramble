This blog is for my personal software development projects.

Any views or opinions that I express are mine, and do not reflect those of the individuals or organizations that I am affiliated with.

Keep in mind that this blog is not affiliated with my employer, and due to my confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, I may not be able to divulge full details of some projects which my company might consider proprietary.  I will also not be writing about work-related conversations, relationships, or stories that might be detrimental to my employer.

My interests change frequently, but I am currently working on geospatial projects, automated feature extraction, C++, C#, LiDAR, out-of-core algorithms, parser optimization, data serialization, hybrid markup processing, and spatial/data indexing.
