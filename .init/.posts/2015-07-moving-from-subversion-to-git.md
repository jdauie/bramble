I am finally moving my personal development projects to Git.  A few years ago, I tried to migrate all my code from Subversion to Git, but I ran into difficulties getting the history to convert properly, and I went back to the status quo.

No longer!  I have begun moving projects over to GitHub starting with [Skhema][].  I don't know yet if I will bother importing history for any projects, but at a minimum it makes it much more convenient to use [Packagist][], for instance.

[packagist]: https://packagist.org/  "Packagist"
