Bramble is my second-generation PHP Web Application Framework (after I scrapped SCMS years ago). It is designed for speed and efficiency, built around the MVC pattern, and able to integrate [Skhema](/schema) and [Subvert](/subvert) into the toolchain to provide powerful functionality quickly. Inspiration from projects like Kohana, Django, Drupal, etc.

Bramble is the engine running this site, and is in ongoing development.
