I am dismantling my personal blog that I had at [joshmorey.com](http://www.joshmorey.com/).  As expected, based on previous attempts, it didn't get much love from me, so for now I will go ahead and post my one personal entry per year here instead.  Deal with it.  

I'll start things off by recyling an old image from that blog, back when I did the [Thursday Night Ride](http://thursdaynightmtbr.org/).
